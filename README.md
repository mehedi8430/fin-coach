## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn add
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

### Development

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

### Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm run build
# or
bun run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
# or
yarn preview
# or
pnpm run preview
# or
bun run preview
```

## Technology Stack

- **React 18**: Latest React features including hooks and concurrent mode
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript
- **Vite**: Next generation frontend tooling with fast cold starts
- **React Router v6**: Declarative routing for React applications
- **Redux Toolkit**: Opinionated Redux setup with best practices
- **Tailwind CSS** (if applicable): Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESLint**: Pluggable JavaScript linter
- **Prettier**: Opinionated code formatter
- **Vitest**: Blazing fast unit test framework powered by Vite

## Available Scripts

- `dev`: Starts the development server
- `build`: Creates a production build
- `preview`: Previews the production build locally
- `lint`: Runs ESLint on the codebase
- `lint:fix`: Runs ESLint and automatically fixes issues
- `format`: Formats code with Prettier
- `test`: Runs unit tests
- `test:watch`: Runs unit tests in watch mode

## ESLint Configuration

This boilerplate comes with a comprehensive ESLint configuration that includes TypeScript-aware linting rules. The configuration is set up to provide:

- Type-aware lint rules for better TypeScript integration
- React-specific linting rules
- Stylistic rules for consistent code formatting

### Enabling Strict Type Checking

For production applications, we recommend enabling strict type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config([
  globalIgnores(["dist"]),
  {
    files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    extends: [
      // Remove tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
      ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
      // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
      ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
      // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
      ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ["./tsconfig.node.json", "./tsconfig.app.json"],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
    },
  },
]);
```

### React-Specific Lint Rules

Install additional plugins for React-specific linting:

```bash
npm install eslint-plugin-react-x eslint-plugin-react-dom --save-dev
```

Then configure in your `eslint.config.js`:

```js
import reactX from "eslint-plugin-react-x";
import reactDom from "eslint-plugin-react-dom";

export default tseslint.config([
  globalIgnores(["dist"]),
  {
    files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    extends: [
      // Enable lint rules for React
      reactX.configs["recommended-typescript"],
      // Enable lint rules for React DOM
      reactDom.configs.recommended,
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ["./tsconfig.node.json", "./tsconfig.app.json"],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
    },
  },
]);
```

## Folder Structure

### `src/assets/`

Contains all static assets including images, icons, and SVG files. Assets are organized in subdirectories for better maintainability.

### `src/components/`

Reusable UI components that can be used across different parts of the application. Components are organized by functionality.

### `src/hooks/`

Custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic and state management patterns.

### `src/layouts/`

Page layout components that define the overall structure of different sections of the application.

### `src/lib/`

Utility libraries and helper functions that are used across the application.

### `src/pages/`

Page-level components that represent individual routes in the application. Each page component is responsible for rendering the content of a specific route.

### `src/providers/`

React context providers that manage global state and provide it to components down the tree.

### `src/redux/`

Redux store configuration, slices for state management, and API endpoints for data fetching.

### `src/routes/`

Application routing configuration that defines the mapping between URLs and components.

### `src/theme/`

Theme configuration including color palettes, typography, and other design system variables.

### `src/types/`

TypeScript type definitions that are used across the application.

### `src/utils/`

Helper functions and utility modules that provide common functionality.

## Component Architecture

The boilerplate follows a component-driven architecture with the following principles:

1. **Atomic Design**: Components are organized from atoms to molecules to organisms
2. **Reusability**: Components are designed to be reusable across the application
3. **Composition**: Complex components are built by composing simpler ones
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Logic, presentation, and styling are separated appropriately

## State Management

State management is handled through a combination of:

1. **React Context API**: For global state that doesn't require complex logic
2. **Redux Toolkit**: For complex state management needs with predictable state transitions
3. **React Hooks**: For local component state

## Routing

The application uses React Router v6 for client-side routing. Routes are defined in the `src/routes/` directory and follow the latest best practices for route configuration.

## Styling

Styling approaches can include:

1. **CSS Modules**: For component-scoped styling
2. **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling (if configured)
3. **Styled Components**: For CSS-in-JS approach (if configured)
4. **Traditional CSS**: With proper naming conventions

## Testing

The boilerplate is configured with Vitest for unit testing. Tests should be colocated with the components they test and follow the naming convention `*.test.tsx`.

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to various platforms:

- **Vercel**: Direct deployment with zero configuration
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop or Git integration
- **GitHub Pages**: Using the gh-pages package
- **Traditional Hosting**: Upload the `dist/` folder to any static hosting service

## Contributing

2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
